Overall Score:
	I aimed for G with ??? points
	

09. Player Death:[Points: 1]
    Health component:
		Exposed a max health variable 
		
		Added a OnDeath and OnRespawn events, which toggles 
		scripts on the player, rather than destroying and 
		instantiating (which is done on both host and client)
		
		Fixed so that OnHealthChanged method is called when current
		health is changed, which call the on death and on respawn
		events based on circumstance

	ServerSingleBullet prefab:
		PS. Increased damage for quicker testing
		

11. Limited Respawn:[Points: 2]
	Health component:
		Added a Respawn method that refills player health,
		which is only done on the host/server side
	
	PlayerRespawn component: 
		Created a player respawn component that handles
		respawn delay, count and random respawn position
		
		Subscribes to CurrentHealth.OnValueChanged and checks
		the current health and starts respawning if dead and
		has spawns left (only on host/server side)
		
	FireAction component:
		Changed so player can't fire when component is disabled
	
	PlayerController component:
		Fixed so OnFire doesn't throw errors if it has no
		events to invoke
